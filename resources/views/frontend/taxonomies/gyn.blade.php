            In general, these specialists experience the highest burnout rate among physicians due to the excessive workload they
            have to deal with when it comes to practice and administration.

            OB/GYN specialists will enjoy the ease of using Atlantis RCM since it takes away the burdens from their shoulders,
            taking off a large amount of the work that needs to be performed each day which can be difficult for them to handle alone.
