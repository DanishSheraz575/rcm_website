        <hr class="gasterology-line">
        <p class="text-grey">
            DME providers face complex coverage rules from government and private payers that dictate medical necessity and add administrative burden, requiring documentation from doctors and availability during audits or payer requests.
        </p>
        <p class="text-grey">
            DME providers face challenges with revenue cycle efficiency due to difficulties in order management, supply chain logistics, documentation, claims processing, and collections. These include coordinating equipment orders, maintaining stock levels, keeping accurate records, navigating insurance requirements, and following up on payments. These challenges can slow down the reimbursement process and impact cash flow.
