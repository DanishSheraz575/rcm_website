        <p class="text-grey">The revenue cycle management services provided
            by Atlantis RCM allows General Surgery to focus on providing quality
            patient care while reducing the administrative burden of managing claims and payments.
        </p>
        <p class="text-grey">Ensure patients have insurance coverage before surgery with
            pre-surgery screening, as part of the revenue cycle management process.
            After surgery, patients will receive post-surgery assessments from their
            doctor or staff members in order to determine if further treatment is
            necessary or if they are ready to leave the hospital.
        </p>
        <p class="text-grey">If you have a pre-surgery screening process or post-surgery
            assessments, we can help you make them more efficient without sacrificing
            quality or reliability. We'll work with you to create processes that are
            tailored to your needs and the needs of your patients.

        <h3 class=" fw-bold pt-3">How Atlantis RCM Helps Surgeons</h3>
        <h5 class=" fw-bold pt-4">Improved financial performance</h5>
        <p class="text-grey">At Atlantis Recovery Care Management, we believe that providing financial
            stability and improved patient care is a delicate balancing act. We know that surgeons are
            under pressure to provide the best care possible while keeping their practices afloat.
            Our mission is to help you achieve this balance by offering:
        </p>
        <h5 class=" fw-bold">Better alignment between processes</h5>
        <p class="text-grey">Surgeons can improve their financial performance by increasing
            revenue and reducing expenses through better alignment between processes, including
            medical billing and collections. The result is fewer days of unpaid claims,
            lower bad debt expense, and more accurate financial reporting.
        </p>
        <h5 class=" fw-bold">Improved patient satisfaction</h5>
        <p class="text-grey">Better patient satisfaction is achieved when physicians have
            access to up-to-date information about their patients’ health status so they
            can provide optimal care. Our solutions allow physicians to keep track of patients’
            lab results and medication information in one place,
            so they can make informed decisions about treatment plans or other interventions needed.
        </p>
        <h5 class=" fw-bold">Increased operational efficiency</h5>
        <p class="text-grey">Increased operational efficiency means less time spent on administrative tasks like
            managing bills or collecting payments from insurance companies so you can focus on what matters most—your patients!
