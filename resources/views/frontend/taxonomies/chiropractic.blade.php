        <p class="text-grey">Chiropractic practices require a specialized approach due to their high proportion of copay patients and the intricate documentation
            of examination and treatment plans by chiropractors. A generic one-size-fits-all technology solution may not effectively address the specific requirements of these practices.</p>

            It offers the required level of flexibility and scalability to provide an optimal solution for chiropractic practices.</p>
