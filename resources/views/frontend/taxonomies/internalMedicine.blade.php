        <hr class="gasterology-line">
        <p class="text-grey">Internal medicine physicians are often overwhelmed with their day-to-day tasks,
            which prevents them from spending time on the more important matters such as patient care. </p>

        <p class="text-grey">Internists need to be able to retrieve up-to-date patient information, lab results,
            and imaging when confronted with diagnosing and treating on the spot when they are dealing with unclear
            symptoms in 30-40 patients throughout the day. As a result of this, internal medicine physicians
            can find themselves being further behind in their billing and collections than other specialties.
        </p>

        <p class="text-grey"> You might find yourself fighting your technology at every stage from scheduling to documentation
            to billing with one-size-fits-all systems. Atlantis RCM makes providing effective care easier and less time-consuming.
        </p>
